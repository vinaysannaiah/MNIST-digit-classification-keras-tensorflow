# MNIST-digit-classification-keras-tensorflow
This repository includes classifying the hand written digits from the MNIST dataset. I have solved this classification problem using both Keras and Tensorflow seperately


## mnist_classification_keras.py


In this program, we shall download the inbuilt MNIST dataset from the Keras framework. Here I am using Keras with Tensorflow background. we shall do the digit classification of the MNIST dataset, using a simple neural network built using Keras. 

In this code we make use of the rmsprop optimizer for back propagation. Please look into the code for a detailed explanation.
