# MNIST-digit-classification-keras-tensorflow
This repository includes classifying the hand written digits from the MNIST dataset. I have solved this classification problem using both Keras and Tensorflow seperately


## mnist_classification_keras.py
In this file we shall download the inbuilt MNIST dataset from the Keras and we shall do the digit classification using a simple neural network built using Keras. In this code we make use of the rmsprop optimizer for back propagation.
Please look into the code for a detailed explanation.
